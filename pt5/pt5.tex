\part{Integration and
Differentiation}


\section{OVERVIEW}

In high school or during your first year of college, you were introduced to differential and
integral calculus. There you learned techniques to obtain analytical or exact derivatives and
integrals.
Mathematically, the derivative represents the rate of change of a dependent variable
with respect to an independent variable. For example, if we are given a function y(t) that
specifies an object's position as a function of time, differentiation provides a means to determine its velocity, as in:
